If you put a rubber plant in the corner of a room, the corner will become more stylish and attractive becase  of its glossy and silky leaves. It has been used for its latex sap to make rubber, hence its nicknames, rubber fig, and rubber tree. These plants are very low maintenance plant.

**Common name :**  Rubber Plant, Rubber tree

**How to Plant :**
Rubber tree can grow from seeds or from stem cuttings. some common species of this plant can also be easily available in a garden nursery.

Also find rubber plant saplings from [theaffordablestore](https://theaffordableorganicstore.idevaffiliate.com/644.html), [Rubber Plant Sapling link](https://theaffordableorganicstore.com/product/rubber-plant-sapling/)

It is very easy to propagate from stem cuttings. Simply cut off a stem and dip it in to a water after the sap(White colored sticky liquid) has dried. Make sure each cutting is at least 4 - 6 inches long and includes atleat 2 - 3 leaf nodes. like image shows.

<!-- ![Photo 11: leaf_node](/assets/leaf_node.webp) -->
<figure style="width: 300px; height: 300px; padding: 0px; margin-top:0px"  class="align-left">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/leaf_node.webp' | absolute_url }}" alt="">
  <!-- <figcaption>this is descriptiion</figcaption> -->
</figure>

Remove the bottom leaves from the cutting, leaving 2 or 3 leaves at the top. 
After 15 to 20 days you can see a small dot size white root, then after change water and keep it in to 3-4 days more
after plant to soil with potting mix with equal amount of coco peat, pine bark (is a pine tree bark powder) or red soil or sand or perlite.

**Active growth period :** It grows best in mid-summer to late summer, before the monsoon starts.  a rubber tree grows mostly 12-20 inches or more in height each growing season, it will grow much faster if kept outdoors but not in direct sunlight.

#### Tips: The growth of the plant can be controlled by pruning.
#### To achive more verticle growth cut bottom old leaves. Make sure not to cut top 12 to 15 inch of the plant. if plant not achived that height yet don't remove leaves.
#### To achive side growth cut top most part 5 - 6 inch of the stem. In this case plant height is minimum 15 - 20 inch, this is to ensure that the bottom part is mature enough to handle more branches.

**Sunlight :** The Rubber Tree needs at least six to eight hours of bright light daily. This can be less light at times, but it is best to give this species medium to bright light.

**Water :** Add water moderately, whenever the top one-inch of soil feels dry. Provide sufficient drainage to plant and avoid excess watering as it may cause root rot. This plant likes sprinkling water on leaves. 

**Humidity :** It can tolerate any level of humidity, including normal room humidity.

**Soil :** Rubber plants require well-draining soil to avoid getting root rot. The soil needs to drain completely between waterings. 

**Temprature :** It is best for a temperature of 65°F to 85°F (18°C-30°C), and not let it go below 60°F (15°C). this plant is native to warm jungle climates!

**Problems cause and solition :**

SYMPTOM: Leaves turning brown and crispy at the edges

CAUSE: Thirsty plant, Underwatered

SOLUTION: Give water regularly atleast once a week if indoor and twise a week for outdoor. Avoid watring if top soil is wet.

**--------------------------------------------**

SYMPTOM: Bottom leaves falling off, fading leaves color

CAUSE: Not receiving enough light

SOLUTION: Keep plan outdoor where it gets filtered sunlight. If plant already outdoor place it in brighter area.

**--------------------------------------------**

SYMPTOM: Dropping leaves

CAUSE: Overwatered

SOLUTION: Repotting and changing soil is the best option, if not possible put the plant outdoor and don't water till the soil dries, also add some perlite and dry coco peat to the soil.

**--------------------------------------------**

SYMPTOM: Yellowing bottom leaves

CAUSE: Leaves are too old

SOLUTION: Remove the leaves
